<tools>
Available tools and their optimal use cases:
1. prompt: The best tool to ask the user to clarify the task or provide more information. Use this tool to ask the user for more details or to clarify the task.
2. unix: Can execute Unix commands and operations. Use this tool for file operations, directory navigation, and other Unix-related tasks.
3. python: Execute Python code and capture the output. Use this tool to run Python code snippets and scripts. Using this tool is dangerous and we need to make sure that the code is safe to run.
4. describe: Summarize the content of a file, especially if it contains code. Use this tool to get an overview of the contents of a file before making changes.

Tool Usage Guidelines:
- You decide whether a tool is needed.
- Always use the most appropriate tool for the task at hand.

Prefer unix commands over anything else, then Python, then any popular scripting language.
